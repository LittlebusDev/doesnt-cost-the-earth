      <h5>
        Founded in the picturesque landscapes of New Zealand, "Doesn't Cost the
        Earth" was born out of a deep love for the environment and a passion for
        fashion. We recognized the need for a brand that seamlessly blends

        vision in mind, we set out to create a brand that empowers you to make
        responsible choices without compromising on your personal style.
